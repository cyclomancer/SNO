Raising engagement and funding of climate change research with Scenario Bonding Curves


dynamic reserve ratio rises with purchase of carbon credits
dividends for carbon credit redemptions
populations of endangered species - Colorado Wildlife Fund
critical technologies: battery, alt energy,
disease - antibiotic resistance
global access to: clean water, internet, etc.


Three legs of effective coordination around global problems: action, information, incentive (ethical, epistemic, economic)
Acceleration of problematics has proceeded in correlation with dissociation of the legs because these phenomena originate in a common dynamic from which human societies must take back the reins
Existing governance mechanisms that control most funding of the creation of critical knowledge and distributing it are short-termist and ruled by regression to the mean

The time is out of joint.

Though we live in the connected age, our time is characterized just as much by disconnections. We know that climate chaos and other global crises entangled with it - from mass extinction to antibiotic resistance - threaten the basis of our civilization. More and more of us believe this and share the will to act on them. Yet we still fail to coordinate manifestation of this collective will with the scale and focus demanded by the problems at hand. Climate science, dependent on short-termist political systems and the limited resources of charity, struggles to convince policymakers 



knowledge of crisis /> knowledge of its progression, coordination of collective will to act


We know that climate chaos and other growing crises entangled with it - from mass extinction to antibiotic resistance - threaten the basis of our civilization. More and more of us share a collective will to act on them. And yet

Sustainable funding of global impact reasearch and epistemic threat mitigation has not been sufficient to keep up with the escalation of their underlying problematics. This is largely the result of a gross misalignment of geopolitical incentives on the issue - charities rely on a limited supply of surplus good will and governments, as we have seen recently in America's withdrawal from the Paris Accord climate agreement, are subject to their own internal political process which tends to be temporally shielded from the macro-incentive architectures of global impact problematics. There is a power differential between a class of insulated policy-makers and a growing portion of humanity which realizes the dire consequences of issues such as climate crisis. The idea of planetary prisoner's dilhemmas is not lost on the upper crust of Silicon Valley's founders and VCs preparing to decamp to luxury bunkers when things start breaking too fast. The growing contingent of humanity conerned about these issues lacks the global coordination mechanisms for signalling and acting on epistemic threats such that their becomings are mitigated before they are realized.

The power of many people to quickly signal their opinions on issues has been enhanced by social media. The rise of climate-change star Greta Thornburg and the ongoing meme-spreading of the Jeffery-Epstein-didn't-kill-himself-network demonstrate that  the mass signalling of opinions naturally emerges into the mass coordination of action. What is missing from these signalling architectures are the means by which such signalling can readily mobilize capital to act on its behalf. To solve these issues, we've built upon existing works in the creation of digital commons spaces and have created our proof-of-concept platform Glopact. gl0pact is a platform which solves two problems in one curve: the incentivizing of signalling on global impact problematics and the securing of capital for research into their abation.
